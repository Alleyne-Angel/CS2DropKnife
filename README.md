# CS2DropKnife
A server-side CS2 plugin powered by CounterStrikeSharp that allows player to share their knife with others.

## How to install

Install CounterStrikeSharp first. Extract the folder you get from [Release](https://github.com/lengran/CS2DropKnife/releases) to the counterstrikesharp/plugins folder.

## How to use

As long as you have a knife equipped, type "!drop" in the chat box and you should see 5 of your knives dropped on the ground.

Note: This plugin might not respond to console "say" or "say_team" commands for now. So your drop bind might not work. Just type it yourself.
