# CS2DropKnife
A server-side CS2 plugin powered by CounterStrikeSharp that allows player to share their knife with others.

## How to install

Install CounterStrikeSharp first ([Installation Guide](https://docs.cssharp.dev/docs/guides/getting-started.html)). Extract the files downloaded from [Release](https://github.com/lengran/CS2DropKnife/releases) to the **game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/CS2DropKnife** folder.

## How to use

As long as you have a knife equipped, type "!drop" in the chat box and you should see 5 of your knives dropped on the ground.

## Version v0.0.1 is still useful

To support some drop key-bind (commands "say !drop" or "say_team !drop" issued from the game console or via a key bind), [version v1.0.0](https://github.com/lengran/CS2DropKnife/releases/tag/v1.0.0) filters all chat messages to manually call the drop knife function.

To avoid this message filtering feature, use [version v0.0.1](https://github.com/lengran/CS2DropKnife/releases/tag/v0.0.1) instead. You can also bind a dropping knife key by binding the command "css_drop" to your preferred keys.
